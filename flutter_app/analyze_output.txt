  error - Couldn't infer type parameter 'T'.

Tried to infer 'dynamic' for 'T' which doesn't work:
  Type parameter 'T' is declared to extend 'num' producing 'num'.
The type 'dynamic' was inferred from:
  Parameter 'a' declared as     'T'
                but argument is 'dynamic'.
  Parameter 'b' declared as     'T'
                but argument is 'dynamic'.

Consider passing explicit type argument(s) to the generic.
